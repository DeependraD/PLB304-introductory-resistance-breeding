Notice about group work for internal evaluation of Introductory Resistance Breeding (PLB 304), Academic year: 2079.

Each groups are assigned to following topics on presentation and review:
  - Group 1: Breeding for insect resistance
  - Group 2: Breeding for drought resistance
  - Group 3: Breeding for heat resistance
  - Group 4: Breeding for mineral stress
  - Group 5: Breeding for cold resistance

- Please be notified that following two dates are alloted for presentation: Kartik 28 and Kartik 29.
- Each presenter group will be given 30 minutes to present and 15 minutes to discuss.
- Groups are also required to prepare a review (not less than 2000 words long) about the respective topics assigned. It may be submitted within Kartik 30.
- Each student from all groups should contribute to the review with their attribution at the beginning.
- The review will be evaluated at 1 marks and class room presentation at 1 marks (out of total 10 as of internal assessment). If anyone will not present (or cannot present) with the group in presentation sessions, they will still have chance to be evaluated on whole 2 marks based on review (but that surely means more effort into review).
