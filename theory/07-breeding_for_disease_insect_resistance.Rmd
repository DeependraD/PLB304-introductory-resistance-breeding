# Biotic Stresses in Agriculture

##

- Selection for yield _per se_ is generally prohibitive.
- Breeding success in the last century was due to selection for individuals with resistance or tolerance to stress.
- Major cause of yield reduction on farmer's fields in most crops
  - FAO estimates that about 25% of the crop losses are due to diseases and pests.
  - Upto 100% yield losses have been reported
  - 80% of potato fields were lost due to \textit{Phytophthora infestans} during 1845 in Ireland and England
  - 37-67% of yield reduction in Soybean due to Asian Rust has been suggested in Brazil during 2006-2011 (US $4 billion loss)
- Economic and environmental burden of fungicide/pesticide application could be offset by development and use of resistant cultivar.

# Breeding for Insect Resistance

##

## Chemical signaling pathways

\bsmall

Example of involvement of glucosinolates in interactions with insect pests (also deterrs slugs). 

```{r glucosinolate-pathways-interaction, fig.align='center', out.width="66%", results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/insect_glucosinolate_signalling.PNG")
cat("\\vspace{-0.4cm}")
```

- Besides interacting with insects,
  - isothiocyanates (a constituent in brassica) are toxic to _Peronospora parasitica_, _Mycosphaerella brassicae_ and _Alternaria_ spp.

# Breeding for Disease Resistance

##

\small
- To address ever evolving relationship between host-pathogen interaction, resistance breeding programmes systematically test wild relatives, landraces and other germplasm to identify new genetic sources of resistance to important pests and pathogens.
- Simple resistance (based on single gene) can be effective in short term, but successful long term resistance requires dealing with genetic complexity.
- Effective disease resistance depends on phenomena thay play out at level of genes, genotypes and populations.
- Gene and genomic loci conferring resistance can be assessed in terms of the strength of their effect, their race specificity and their potential contribution towards durability.
- At genotype level, performance of resistance is influenced by the number of resistance genes and their specific combination in host
  - indirect effects on valued traits also need to be taken into account
- At population level, effects on the durability of resistance and the spread of disease need to be considered

(\footnotesize Based on a Review article by @nelson2018navigating)

##

\small
- Plant breeders prefer broad-spectrum (race-nonspecific) resistance conferred by QRLs.
- Genes conferring multiple disease resistance (MDR) are much valued -- they tend also to be durable.
  \bitemize
  \footnotesize
  \item Causal genes for MDR are not clearly identified
  \item But, either genetic linkage or pleiotropy have roles in MDR
  \item Single pleiotropic gene or tightly linked genes can be moved between cultivars through traditional breeding
  \item example: \textit{LR34} (encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter rather than an NLR and provides incomplete resistance; \alert{it can actually be considered to be a strong QRL}) in wheat condition such resistance
  \eitemize
- Combining multiple R-genes and/or QRLs into a single genome usually improves its resistance phenotype -- an approach called gene pyramiding.

```{r diff-qrl-pyramid}
tribble(
  ~"QRL", ~"Gene pyramid",
  "QRL are generally additive in effect, although non-additive effects are also sometimes observed", "Pyramiding of R-genes can improve the spectrum of resistance; genes with complementary resistance spectra can be selected such that gene pyramids provide resistance to a broad set of pathogen races") %>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Difference between gene pyramid and QRL") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 6) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1:2, width = c("24em", "30em"))
```


## Epidemiology and forcasting

```{r rust-epidemiology-network, fig.cap="A early-warning system to improve preparedness and resilience to emerging rust diseases on wheat, based on Europe by monitoring rust populations -- identification, and investigation of virulence, agressiveness and adaptation to warmer temperatures.", out.width="95%"}
