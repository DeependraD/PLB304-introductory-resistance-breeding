# Defense mechanism against pathogens and parasites

## Disease escape or avoidance

- Not even a true resistance mechanism
  - maturing plants may complete their growth and produce seeds before epidemics of foliar diseases have progressed far enough to cause significant damage
- Wheat stem rust epidemics in US begin with overwintered infections in winter wheat plants near the Gulf Coast. \textit{P. graminis} develops best in warm weather, so stem rust epidemics develop slowly during the spring. One reason for the decline of stem rust damage in the Central Plains states of Oklahoma and Kansas was the switch to earlier maturing winter wheat cultivars in those states in the 1930s and 1940s.
- Reduction in the population density of host plants

##

- Morphological feature  of plants enabling them to avoid infection
- Tuber rot in stored potatoes is initiated primarily in wounds to the tubers incurred during harvesting/transport. Rapid healing by development of a suberized layer over the wounded tissue is considered most critical aspect of resistance therein.
- Floral development is important in the resistance of wheat to ergot caused by \textit{Claviceps purpurea}.
  - pathogen invades the ovules by way of stigmas of the rye florets
  - $\because$ rye is typically cross-pollinated, the unfertilized stigmas are exposed to ascospores
  - however, once ovules are fertilized, stigmas are no longer receptive to infection
  - $\because$ wheat is self-pollinated, stigmas are no longer receptive to infection by the time they become exposed to pathogen spores in air
  - male sterile lines of wheat tend to be infected heavily as rye by ergot! 

##

- Failure of anther extrusion in barley cultivars leads to partial escape from Fusarium head blight.
- Covering of leaf epidermis with hairs or waxes that repel water
- Upright geometry of foliage cause water droplets to roll off the leaves allowing them to dry rapidly
- Plants unattractive to potential vectors escape infection even if they are susceptible to the vector-borne pathogen
- Rice cultivars selected for more efficient silicon uptake have morphological resistance to \textit{M. grisea} (mentioned earlier).
- In wheat stem rust caused by \textit{P. graminis}:
  - seedlings exhibit no morphological resistance
  - adult plants allow growth of pathogen only in the chlorophyllous collenchyma bundles of stems
  - cultivars with narrow, isolated strands of collenchyma bundles separated by broad bands of sclerenchyma are partially resistant to stem rust in adult plants  
  
## Resistance

- Ability of plant to reduce the growth and/or development of the parasite after contact has been initiated or established.
- Mechanisms of resistance are better suited against pathogen and endoparasites, rather than herbivores.
- In ecological terms, resistance is occurs in the events of antibiosis\footnote[frame]{A biological interaction between two organisms that is deterimental to at least one of them.}
- Various pathogens are susceptible to a broad range of chemical defense compounds (owing to their antibiotic properties):
  - tannins
  - phenolic compounds
  - dienes
  - saponins
  - proteases
  - hydrolytic enzymes
- Seeds typically have higer concentration of antibiotic compounds than vegetaive parts of annual plants

## Tolerance

- A mechanism that enables plants to recover from infection or herbivory inflicted damage thus leading to milder form of symptoms.
- In virology, when the virus concentration in the plants is relatively high, the conclusion that the plants are tolerant is justified.

## Induced response to invasion

\footnotesize
- Plants respond to woulds in a non-specific production of corky tissue that wall off the broken area of the epidermis. Similar barriers are produced in the woody stems and roots of trees or other perennial plants in response to canker-forming pathogens.
  - speed at which a plant produces such barrier is a measure of its generalized resistance
- Cell walls in the epidermis may induce thickenings in reponse to pathogens attempting to penetrate their outer walls.
  - walls thickenings are often infused with phenolic substances
- Wilt disease fungi typically grow through the xylem and tend to cut off water flow to aerial parts of the plant
  - plant may wall off the pathogen by forming tyloses within xylem cells
- Plants activate pathways to produce characteristic antibiotic compounds called phytoalexins in the cells around the site of attack
  - if the response is soon enough and extensive, plant may display partial resistance
- The rate of response of the host may depend on its ability to recognize that it is being invaded.

##

\begin{description}
\item[Systemic acquired resistance] An induced defense in host may confer long lasting protection against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms (i.e. viral, bacterial, and fungal)
\end{description}
- Enhanced resistance against subsequent attack by a wide array of pathogen.
- As in partial/horizontal resistance, SAR takes 24-48 hours to onset and can last for several months.
- It may be induced by certain synthetic chemicals, _viz_. salicylic acid, 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) and benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid-S-methyl ester (BTH).
- Pathogen recognition triggers a number of rapid cellular responses, including ionic changes and phosphorylation cascades, which preced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric acid (NO) and salicylic acid (SA) and transcriptional activation of defense related gene.
- Through epigenetic changes in the host genome, the resistance may be transmitted across generations. 

##

- In many cases of host-pathogen interaction, genes in one organism are triggered to be expressed by a substance produced by the other organism. For example,
  - genes for cell wall-degrading enzymes in the pathogen are induced by the presence of monomers or oligomers of host cell wall macromolecules that are substrates for these enzymes.
  - genes for defense reactions in the host, eg. phytoalexins, are triggered to expression by certain signal compounds activated by inducer molecules (elicitors) produced by the pathogen.

# Genetics of disease and resistance mechanism

## At population and genotypic level

\bcolumns
\column{0.55\textwidth}
\footnotesize
- In order to understand disease, genetics of causal agent need to be elucidated 
- Characters in individuals including pathogens are variable mostly as a result of
  \begin{itemize}
  \scriptsize
  \item Sexual process -- oospores, ascospores and basidiospores (in oomycetes and fungi); seeds of higher plants and eggs of nematodes
  \item Asexual process -- (owing to astronomical number of microorganism individuals produced) conidia, zoospores, sclerotia and uredospores (in fungi); bacteria, mollicutes and viruses
  \end{itemize}
- Sexually reproducing organisms generate variability through segregation and recombination of genes, and even in asexually reproducing pathogens (bacteria) variants are produced by mutations.

\column{0.45\textwidth}

\footnotesize

- Factors affecting gene flow and genotype fitness are major drivers for evolution of both plant pathogen and host population\footnote[frame]{\scriptsize Refer to lecture notes of Population Genetics on factor affecting gene and genotype frequency changes}.
- Reproductive cycle of pathogen vary considerably, with oomycetes and fungi having some of the most complex reproduction systems.

## At genetic level

\footnotesize
- Genetic information (determines the form and function) is encoded as DNA or (exceptionally) RNA.
  \begin{itemize}
  \scriptsize
  \item Nucleus (follows Mendalian inheritance)
  \item Mitochondria -- susceptibility genes for southern corn leaf blight caused by \textit{Bipolaris maydis} and yellow leaf blight caused by \textit{Phyllosticta maydis}
  \item Plasmid (autonomously replicating)
  \item Chloroplasts
  \end{itemize}
- A gene (in general) is characterized by:
  \begin{itemize}
  \scriptsize
  \item 100-500 codon triplets
  \item Coding and and non-coding region
  \item Protein or RNA as code product
  \end{itemize}
- Genetic processes
  \begin{itemize}
  \scriptsize
  \item Replication
  \item Transcription
  \item Translation
  \item Regulatory elements -- promoters, enhancers, silencers or terminators
  \end{itemize}

## Defense mechanisms against bacteria and fugi


\scriptsize
- \alert{Signalling} transcription of a plant defense response involves more than 1500 transcript factors. Mutation analysis allowed identification of some genes regulating signal transduction in a cell. These genes were called **RDR** (Required for Disease Resistance). In tomato, 4 unlinked genes have been identified: _Rcr1_, _Rcr2_, _Rcr3_, and _Rcr5_ (Required for _C. fulvum_ resistance). Rcr3 controls synthesis of cysteic protease which is secreted in the apoplast space. HR induction in tomato with resistance gene Cf2 requires proteins Rcr3 (cysteic protease) and avr2 (cysteic protease inhibitor). Therefore, Cf2 is a guard protein that recognizes interaction of avr2 and Rcr3 and induces HR. Rcr3 has no effect on resistance controlled by the other Cf-genes; mutations in the other genes cause partial reduction of resistance. The RDR functions in barley are possessed by genes Ror1 and Ror2 (necessary to elicit resistance by gene _mlo_) and Rar1 (encodes a small, highly conserved $\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}$ binding protein), and Rar2 (involved in generating oxidative burst in defense responses caused by gene _Mla_) [@dyakov2007comprehensive].
- Mitochondrial genes of some corn varieties (Texas male-sterile cytoplasm) renders plant susceptible to Bipolaris as the host plant encodes for a receptor that binds to the corresponding toxin produced by the pathogen.

# Defense mechanisms against insects and herbivory

## Non preference/non-acceptance/antixenosis

\footnotesize
- Term 'antixenosis' was first used to refer to non-preference by Kogan and Ortman, 1972.
- Host varieties are unattractive or unsuitable for colonization, oviposition or both by an insect pest.
- Insects will not accept resistant host even if there is no alternative source of food.
- Non-preference of a host strain is detectable only when the preferred host strain is present.
- Degrees of non-preference by insects varies. For example, in aphids,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item insects avoid resistant plants $\longrightarrow$ raspberry
  \item insects feed transiently before appearing restless and walking-off to susceptible hosts $\longrightarrow$ sugarbeet
  \item the striped stem borer moth has a strong preference for oviposition on certain rice varieties. Susceptible varieties receive 10-15 times more egg masses than resistant ones.
  \end{itemize}

##

\footnotesize
- Non-preference is manifested with respect to activities such as colonization, egg laying, feeding, pupation, etc.
- Morphological features of host plant prevent insects from approaching, landing, settling, feeding or oviposition.
- Biochemicals (allomones/kairomones) produced by certain plants make them more preferable than others
  \begin{itemize}
  \item lower levels of cucurbitacins in fruits fend-off beetles in cucurbits
  \item in rice, brown plant-hoppers attack susceptible rice varieties because of presence of asparagine in relatively higher concentrations 
  \end{itemize}
- Physical factors (shape, size, color, pubescence, tissue characteristics and secretions) also cause non-preference
- In polyphagous insect (e.g. Heliothis zea) non-preference may not be an effective mechanism of resistance since the insect will multiply on alternate hosts. 

\scriptsize (Refer to Chapter 9 on Chemical ecology of plant-insect interaction, @mithofer2009chemical (Annual Plant Reviews, Volume 34))

## Antibiosis

- Refers to an adverse effect of feeding on a resistant host plant on the development and/or reproduction at various stages (broadly termed _life history_ factors) of the insect pests
- Effect of continued feeding despite antibiosis range from death of instar/nymph or larve, reduction in survival ability of over-wintering insects and death of adult insect on the extreme.
- In maize, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazine-3-one (DIMBOA) has been identified as the biochemical that inhibits the growth of the larve of Europen corn borer.
- Type and availability of primary metabolites may also be basis of antibiosis as it may cause nutritional imbalance in insect pests, e.g. pea varieties with $\small\Downarrow$ level of amino acids and $\small\Uparrow$ level of sugar show resistance to pea aphids ( _Acyrthosiphon pisum_)

## Tolerance

- Insect pest attack the tolerant variety to the same degree as a susceptible one, but at the same level of infestation, a tolerant variety can compensate for/recover from the damage without loosing the yield that the susceptible variety does. 
- Involves factors like -- vigor, compensatory growth rate, stage of life cycle of crop, wound healing, mechanical support in tissues/organs, segment of the crop which incurred damage and photosynthate partitioning.
- Tolerant variety of maize (for example) repair and replaces the roots damaged by western corn root-worm ( _Diabrotica virgifera_).
