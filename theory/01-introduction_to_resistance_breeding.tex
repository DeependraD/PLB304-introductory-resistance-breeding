  Biological efficiency of production (expressed as unit of the product
  per unit of absorbed solar energy, or conveniently as kg/hectare) is a
  relative measurement and it varies according to the environment, with
  the cultivar, and especially with its variations.
\item
  A proper biological index could help plant breeders in obtaining
  cultivars with better efficiency in using natural resources.
\item
  Yield potential (a theoretical idea) can be defined as the yield
  obtained when the cultivar is grown with no environmental restrictions
  -- with no biotic or abiotic stresses.

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item soil nutrients and water are not limiting
  \item pests and weeds are effectively controlled
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Crop yield potential (genetic) is much larger than the biological
  efficiency per area (recorded yield) owing to several environmental
  influences and management practices -- collectively called
  \alert{stresses}.

  A plant parasite is an organism that becomes intimately associated
  with a plant and multiplies or grows at the expense of the plant
  (removes nutrients and water from the host)
\item
  Parasitism is associated with pathogenicity, i.e., the ability of a
  pathogen to cause disease, as the ability of the parasite to invade
  and become established in the host generally results in the
  development of a diseased condition.

\item
  Mostly, soil-borne pathogens are most damaging in wet soil
\item
  Foliar diseases such as wheat stem rust, thrive in hot weather while
  other, such as wheat stripe rust, require cool temperatures.
\item
  Nearly all foliar pathogens (with exclusion of powdery mildew fungi)
  require high moisture for their initial growth on leaf or stem surface
  before they penetrate the interior regions.
\item
  Breeding for disease resistance involves exposing breeding populations
  to induced epidemics or to natural epidemics in known ``hot spots''.
\item
  Breeder's objective is to optimize the pathogen and environmental
  sides of the disease triangle to provide consistent epidemics of
  sufficient severity to clearly damage susceptible breeding lines
  without also destroying lines with useful levels of resistance.

  between them need to be considered.

  Durability of resistance is affected by emergence of new races of the
  disease/pest that are able to overcome existing resistance
\item
  Environmental changes (brought about by global warming) also affects
  the dynamics of plant interactions with pests and diseases and render
  crops more or less susceptible to biotic stresses, owing to:

  \begin{itemize}

    changed distribution of phytophagous insects (lepidopterans)
  \item
    changes in crop and insect phenology synchrony (emergence)

  \citet{flor1956complementary} was the first to show there was a
  `gene-for-gene' relationship between the pathogen's avirulence (
  \emph{Avr}) genes and the resistance ( \emph{R}) genes of its host.
\item
  ``A resistance gene, \(R\) is only effective if the infecting pathogen
  carries the corresponding avirulence gene, \(A\)''.
\item
  Host resistance is conditioned by dominant allele, \(R\).
\item
  In the pathogen, virulence is conditioned by recessive allele, \(a\)
\item
  Resistance reaction occurs when complementary genes in both host and
  pathogen are dominant.
\item
  A host genotype that carries no dominant alleles at any of the loci is
  susceptible for all the races of pathogen (even if avirulent).
\item
  An \(A\) (avirulent) allele is dominant over \(a\) (virulent) allele
  and resistant allele \(R\) is dominant over susceptible allele \(r\).

  Compatibility depends on the genotype of the host and the genotype of
  the pathogen.

  \item Pathogen non-specific major gene resistance to cover those cases of monogenic resistance that are known to lack race specificity,
    \begin{itemize}
    \scriptsize
    \item Resistance in maize to \textit{Cochliobolus heterostrophus} due to single gene (a gene for sensitivity of the host to patho-toxin). Pathogens lacking the ability to produce the toxin are avirulent and host plants without the gene for toxin sensitivity are resistant. No alternative form of the toxin gene (HC-toxin) has been found that is not inactivated by the host gene product.
    \item In cultivars of cabbage, single genes for resistance to cabbage yellow disease caused by soilborne \textit{Fusarium oxysporum} f. \textit{conglutinans} haven proven durable.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Horizontal polygenic resistance,
  \item Interaction resistance, which relies on use of mixed populations of host lines with different genes for vertical resistance to avoid rapid selection of races virulent to any single resistance gene in mixture.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Induced resistance, even if its effects are only local, may
  substantially reduce the ability of virulent races to infect the

  Studies on major genes have provided understanding of pathogen

  \(R\) genes typically show dominant phenotypes and mostly encode
  proteins involved in pathogen recognition.

  Recessive resistance may be caused by loss-of-function variants of

  response:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity
    (PTI) known as basal resistance -- contributes to quantitative
    resistance
  \item
    Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) -- forms basis of qualitative
    resistance
  \end{itemize}
\item
  PTI is broad-spectrum resistance triggered in response to conserved
  pathogen features as recognized at plant cell surface via conserved
  pattern receptors (PRRs), which are typically membrane-localized
  receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or wall-associated kinases (WAKs).

  \begin{itemize}

    resistance\footnote[frame]{A phenomenon whereby most plants are resistant to most microbial pathogens.}

  domain leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) genes, and most R-genes
  encode cytosolic NLR proteins.
\item
  Some R-genes encode detoxification enzymes, while other encode WAKs.
\item
  ETI is often manifested as a hypersensitive response (HR): that is,
  rapid cell death localized at the point of pathogen penetration.
