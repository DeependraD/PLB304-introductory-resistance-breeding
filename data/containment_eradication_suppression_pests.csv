Physical Hand collecting/control pulling or hand cutting,"Invertebrates, plants, amphibian, pathogens",• Fairly specific to target pest,• Can cause disturbance that can encourage invasion by other invasive species (weeds)
,,• Can be used in ecologically sensitive areas,"• Labor intensive, best for small areas"
,,• Efficient method for slow‐growing species,• Often requires repeat treatments
,,,
,,,
